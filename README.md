The morphological gradient in seismic areas with slopes ≥15° can influence the propagation of seismic waves, amplifying their energy and increasing the risks of landslides or ground subsidence. This plugin identifies areas with a morphological gradient with slopes ≥15° within seismic zones (Input vector file) starting from the DTM
